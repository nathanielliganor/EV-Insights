# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis in the US

## Project Overview

This project delves into the electric vehicle (EV) landscape within the United States, focusing on the prevalence and distribution of EVs across the nation. As the shift towards sustainable transportation gains momentum, understanding the current state of EV adoption is crucial for policymakers, manufacturers, and consumers alike. This analysis leverages a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, which has been transformed and analyzed through a MySQL database to explore various facets of the EV population.

## Objectives
- To provide background information on the electric vehicle population in the US and discuss the prevalence of EVs.
- To analyze data pertaining to the electric vehicle population, focusing on aspects such as location, car type, and specific electric vehicle identifiers (CAFV IDs).
- To utilize a dataset from Kaggle, creating a structured database in MySQL for efficient querying and analysis.
- To clean and preprocess the data, ensuring accuracy in vehicle locations, types, and identifiers.
- To perform comprehensive queries to extract all relevant rows of data for analysis.

## Methodology

The project was conducted using a series of structured steps, employing MySQL for data storage and manipulation, along with R for data analysis and visualization:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Sourced a detailed dataset from Kaggle related to the electric vehicle population in the US.
2. **Database Creation**: Developed a MySQL database to efficiently manage and query the dataset, allowing for robust data manipulation and extraction.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Conducted thorough data cleaning to align vehicle locations, types, and CAFV IDs correctly, ensuring data integrity and relevance.
4. **Data Querying**: Executed comprehensive SQL queries to retrieve all rows of data pertinent to the study's objectives, focusing on the distribution and characteristics of the EV population.
5. **Analysis and Visualization**: Utilized R to analyze the queried data, focusing on identifying patterns, trends, and insights regarding EV prevalence across different regions in the US.

## Findings and Conclusion

The analysis unveiled significant insights into the electric vehicle population in the US, highlighting areas with higher EV adoption rates and the diversity of EV types across the nation. By cleaning and querying the dataset, we were able to pinpoint specific trends in EV distribution, including the concentration of certain car types and the alignment of EV populations with urban versus rural areas.

The findings from this project contribute valuable knowledge to the ongoing discussion about sustainable transportation and EV adoption in the US, offering a data-driven basis for future policy and infrastructure planning.

## Future Work

Future research directions could include a longitudinal analysis to track the growth of the EV population over time, as well as a comparative study of EV adoption rates between different states or regions. Additionally, integrating data on charging infrastructure could provide deeper insights into the ecosystem supporting EV adoption.
